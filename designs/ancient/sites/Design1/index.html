					<h2>Web Design</h2>
					<p>While I do enjoy writing in more complicated, back end languages such as Java, I sometimes enjoy playing around with and designing for front end languages such as web technologies; including, but not limited to HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.</p>

					<h2>Graphics</h2>
					<p>I combine web design, photography, and coding through creating general graphics. I both write graphics (freely animated and interactive) and do graphic design.</p>

					<h2>Photography</h2>
					<p>A skill that I consider to be one that is mostly distant from "creation", as it is much more the "capture" of an image, vision, or idea. I enjoy simply capturing an image or attempting to tell a story, and sometimes that expands to video creation.</p>
