				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p align="left" style="width: 675px;">Tyler French is a 10th grade student at East Chapel Hill High School in the class of 2017. In school, the subjects that appeal to him the greatest are Engineering (which is provided by the <a href="http://pltw.org">Project Lead The Way</a> organization), Statistical Math, and Science. <br/><br/>Tyler creates and produces content from a variety of multimedia perspectives. He is a cinematographer and video producer; he works with visual effects, graphics, and has worked for a number of organizations: these included Raleigh Ring of Fire (and ultimate team), EnvisionWith.me, Raleigh Flyers, TYUL, CFS Building Friends Foundation, and more. (check out a small showcase of his work on his <a href="http://youtube.com/tfrenchproductions">YouTube</a>). He has also worked with music composition, and some software/web development. This website is primarily to showcase the projects he's developed and the projects he has contributed to its development. These projects can be found in the <a href="projects.php">project page.</a><br/><br/>In his free-time, Tyler enjoys playing Ultimate Frisbee and running Cross Country for ECHHS. Over the summer, he was a member of an Ultimate Frisbee club team, entitled "NC Hammer", which placed second in the Youth National Championship in Blaine, Minnesota (as runners-up to Seattle, WA).<br/><br/>Thanks for visiting and have a wonderful day!</p>
