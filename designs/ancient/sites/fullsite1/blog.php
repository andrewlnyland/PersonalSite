								<h3>October 4, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today we learned about the apprentices handbook. We learned about the codes of conduct, the agreements, and the policies of which we all are required to follow. We learned about general office ethics and workplace professionalism. Most importantly, we learned that it is important to stay consistently on task and to avoid distraction.<br/><br/>On my own, I began to start construction on my Shodor Apprentice Website. I went over basic HTML and CSS with the tutorials provided for us on the Shodor Website.</p>

								<h3>October 11, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today we learned about problem solving and the different methods for these tasks. We went through a list of vocabulary terms relating to correctly understanding and computing/analyzing different tasks/problems we are given. We learned differences between consistent and conclusive, proof and evidence, sufficient and necessary as well as convention and definition. Computers calculate in binary, so it is also important to understand that algebra and complex math done on a computer is always approximate (unless it is mathematics calculated from numbers of base 2). I also met with my mentor today.</p>

								<h3>October 18, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today, we began the day by learning about modeling. Through a cool exercise with Bob, we learned that we can simplify how we tie knots by representing it with mathematics. We thought about all the different things we could represent with rope. We can represent things visually, behaviorally, and mathematically. We then proceeded to make a model in excel. The excel mathematical model modeled the diffusion of heat. We were able to color code the different parts of the model in order to show the diffusion of heat. We used a limited iterations so it is able to calculate circular formulas. Then we created a disease population model in excel.</p>

								<h3>November 1, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today I learned about basic Command Line skills in Terminal, and I learned about the language they are given in, UNIX. I learned about how to manipulate folders, directories, files and other items within Terminal.<br/><br/><img src="images/command.png" style="width:335px;"/></p>

								<h3>November 8, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today I learned about modeling with agents in a program called Vensim. We learned about Have Boxes, Rate Pipes, Influence Arrows, and knowledge pieces. We created a SIR model; a model representing the spread of disease with the measure of the population of 3 categories: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. The influence of "sick fractions" and "recovery fractions" allowed us to manipulate the amount of people who contracted the disease over time. We then learned how to create a live model and replace these constants with sliders, so we can see the effects of changing them.</p>

								<h3>November 15, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today, we explored the different types of computer modeling. We began with looking at the more advanced features of Vensim, such as the SyntheSim, a live simulation with editable values. We worked on more advanced graphing and information display from our models. After we finished looking at System based modeling, we began looking at Agent-based modeling in a program called AgentSheets. We created complex SIR models that explained how individuals interacted with each other in a population. I also had a meeting with my mentor Ron today</p>

								<h3>November 22, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today, we began group work on our final projects for this semester. I was able to create a Vensim model showing the relationship between tagged fish, untagged fish, and seals in the environment using a predator-prey representation. I was able to create an efficient model, which was visually organized and gave successful results. I was able to add a 4th animal, the tagged seals, and figure out ways to balance the habitat to maintain relatively constant populations of both groups. I was able to output this data successfully to a graph, which modeled the change over time.</p>

								<h3>December 6, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">This Saturday, we spend the day working on and improving our personal projects. I was able to troubleshoot some small lurking errors to my original Vensim model, and then I was able to introduce a new categorical variable of gender. This new variable allowed me to create a more accurate representation of reproduction within the populations of organisms. This model was complicated, and I hope to continue to improve upon it more. I also met with my mentor Ron today, which concludes my final necessary meeting before the winter break.</p>

								<h3>December 13, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">This weekend concludes the final workshop of our fall semester. Today, Andrew Nyland and I gave our presentation of our Fish and Seal predator-prey relationship models in Vensim and AgentSheets. Today we worked very hard on trying to make our material presentable and available to be viewed on both of our websites. I finalized my <a href="projects.php">portfolio</a> to hold this work. After I had all of my required assignments and my presentation completed, I worked on further stylizing my website (under development). Progress can be viewed <a href="index.php">here</a>.</p>

								<h3>December 13, 2014</h3>
								<p class="description">Today we continued our work in JavaScript. We began the morning by reviewing some of the more simple elements of JavaScript. We worked with math and loops working with challenges to find certain numbers with certain properties. We then went on to learn about more complex models using arrays. We learned how to define arrays, how to fill values into the cells, and how to view properties of the array (such as length). We created models using arrays to show their practical uses. Finally, we began working with Objects. Objects act similar to arrays in concept although their properties are defined with names rather than numerical values. We learned how to define them and how to apply their uses.</p>
