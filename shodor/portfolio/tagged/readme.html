<h1>Fish and Seals Agentsheet Model: Tagged</h1>
<p>In the modeled environment, there are 4 different population groups: tagged fish, untagged fish, tagged seals, and untagged seals. The seals are the natural predators of the fish, and they behave as such in the model. A seals lifespan is limited if it is unable to eat fish. Although there is no prey expressing the prey of the fish, we assume they are well-nourished and have a set life span. In the population, certain fish are tagged, with electronic trackers in order for scientists to conduct research. Although it is seemingly harmless, the tags attract seals, and make them more vulnerable as prey. In the model, seals can sense the tagged fish, and are automatically attracted to the. There are also tagged seals, which, because of their tag, are easier for the fish to recognize. The fish are modeled to run away from the seals they can hear, the tagged seals. As both populations continue to die off over time, there are new individuals of all 4 population born into the environment, modeled by a proportion to their current population.</p>
