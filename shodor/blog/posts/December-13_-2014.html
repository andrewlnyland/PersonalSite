<p>On our final day before the holidays, we enthusiastically began working on the final aspects of our projects. I completed my website and my second model, tested both of them, 
    				and configured them so that they were presentable to the rest of our group of apprentices. Then, we went group by group and presented each of our projects, while also describing 
    				problems that we had with the models and how we overcame them, pros and cons of using different modeling methods, and what we may have added if we had had more time. These models can be viewed <a href="../portfolio">here.</a></p>
