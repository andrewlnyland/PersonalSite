<p>I had been sick during the last few days of October, so I came into Shodor on November 7th to catch up on what I had missed. We began looking at the fundamentals of working from a unix command line and how a linux file system works and is setup. We learned skills such as moving between directories, creating files, editing and saving files, and moving and copying files.</p>
