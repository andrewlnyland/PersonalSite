<p>We began looking at the pre-thinking to computational modeling; real life modeling. We attempted to model and simulate as many objects as we could using simple objects, such as short piece of rope. We began also looking at how math relates to physical models. We also created our first model, which was simulating diffusion in Excel and we also built models such as a slope intercept table.</p>
