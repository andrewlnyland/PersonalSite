    				<h2>Blog Entry: October 4th, 2014</h2>
    				<p>On our first day we introduced ourselves to each other, became acquainted with both the other people and the workspace, and we looked at and talked about what the rest of the year would be like. 
    				Next Ron Broadnax gave us an entertaining, comical, and informative class on work ethics. He was able to give us an effective lesson on first impression by showing up at first as an incorrectly dressed, 
    				late, and disoriented employee.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h2>Blog Entry: October 11th, 2014</h2>
    				<p>Our second day jumped to an increased pace as Dr. Panoff delivered a vigorous and enlightening class on many subjects mostly based around scientific procedures and thought processes. He explained to us the 
    				thoughts behind Expectation-Observation-Reflection and the difference between many synonyms such as necessary/sufficient, consistent/conclusive, and many others. He concisely taught the difference between what we think and what we know.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h2>Blog Entry: October 18th, 2014</h2>
    				<p>We began looking at the pre-thinking to computational modeling; real life modeling. We attempted to model and simulate as many objects as we could using simple objects, such as short piece of rope. We began also looking at how math relates to 
    				physical models. We also created our first model, which was simulating diffusion in Excel and we also built models such as a slope intercept table.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h2>Blog Entry: November 7th, 2014</h2>
    				<p>I had been sick during the last few days of October, so I came into Shodor on November 7th to catch up 
    				on what I had missed. We began looking at the fundamentals of working from a unix command line and how a linux file system works and is setup. 
    				We learned skills such as moving between directories, creating files, editing and saving files, and moving and copying files.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h2>Blog Entry: November 8th, 2014</h2>
    				<p>Today we continued to look at working from the unix command line; reviewing what we had already learned and discovering how to apply to real life methods and uses 
    				such as connecting to and working on a server from a command line. Most importantly for us, we learned how to access our files our shodor from almost everywhere and 
    				how to work on them in such an environment.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h2>Blog Entry: November 22nd, 2014</h2>
    				<p>Nearing the end of our fall session, we began to confront any confusion or uncertainty that we had with anything that we had learned so far and we began working 
    				on our final projects. Based on the idea of seals who eat fish and whether tagging these species so that they other species knows where they are and reacts, we paired up 
    				and began planning and creating our models.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h2>Blog Entry: December 6th, 2014</h2>
    				<p>Continuing from our previous session, we again worked with our partner to further progress and improve our models. I was able to finish the first model and begin the second 
    				model for our final project. I also began work on my shodor website.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h2>Blog Entry: December 13th, 2014</h2>
    				<p>On our final day before the holidays, we enthusiastically began working on the final aspects of our projects. I completed my website and my second model, tested both of them, 
    				and configured them so that they were presentable to the rest of our group of apprentices. Then, we went group by group and presented each of our projects, while also describing 
    				problems that we had with the models and how we overcame them, pros and cons of using different modeling methods, and what we may have added if we had had more time. These models can be viewed <a href="../portfolio">here.</a></p>
