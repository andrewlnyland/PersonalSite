I am Andrew Nyland. I'm 20 and currently study Computer Science at Virginia Tech.<br>
<p>I lived in NC for most of my life. Spent a lot of time outside and had restricted access to tech until high school.
I began learning python in 6th grade, web design before 8th, and film production by 9th. By the end of high school
I was mostly doing photography and web based development.</p>
