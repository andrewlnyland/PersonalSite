<h2>My time at Shodor</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.shodor.org/">Shodor Education Foundation</a> in Durham, NC, is a computational science education organization (founded in 1994) that focuses on teaching students and providing resources and instruction for instructors. They provide classes, workshops, and various levels of internships, and attempt to incite and continue interest in STEM topics through interactive sessions and real world problems. Nationally recognized and unique, Shodor delivers their skills and knowledge, through structured and moderately paced lessons, to mostly middle and high school students throughout the year.</p>
<p>I became involved with Shodor in the summer of 2012, when I took an Introduction to Programming class and an Introduction to iPhone Programming class. The classes presented a clear introduction to their respective topics, but at the time, because of my previous exposure to such topics, I was unable to grasp their content fully. Throughout each week of these classes, I slowly understood more, with the Introduction to programming class introducing me to the skills of programming and ultimately, web programming and design, and then the Introduction to iPhone Programming giving me an introduction to higher end programming, writing in a compiled language, and the capabilities of such languages.</p>
<p>Over the next year, I began writing simple iPhone apps and exploring much farther into web languages. Over the next few years, I successfully taught myself HTML, CSS, and experimented with many diverse website designs. After a short time I returned to what Shodor had taught me, reviewed the basics of JavaScript, and then I began learning and writing much more advanced javascript.</p>
<p>The following summer (2013), I returned to Shodor and took a class on Parallel Programming, and I retook the two classes that I had previously taken (and I understood everything that was presented).</p>
<p>During the summer of 2014, I returned to Shodor to participate in their Shodor Scholars Program, which is an intense 2-week course that covers many subjects and is designed to be an example of and preparation for their Apprenticeship program. Following the Shodor Scholars Program, I applied and was accepted into the Apprenticeship Program.</p>
<p><img src="sealjs.png" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0"/>Shodorâ€™s Apprenticeship Program is a year long program where participants learn various skills such as computer modeling (both system and agent based), programming, web languages, and engineering.</p>
<p>While in the Apprenticeship program, participants create a web site (hosted by shodor; originally designed from a template, and later designed by us) to document what they create, and keep a log of what we did each session. A copy of my site can be found <a href="http://shodorsite.andrewnyland.net"><b>here</b></a> (originally hosted at <a href="http://www.shodor.org/~anyland">shodor.com/~anyland</a>).</p>
